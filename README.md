# Life Course Epi Simulation (R) {.tabset}

Does selective survival prior to study enrollment attenuate estimated effects of education on rate of cognitive decline in older adults? A simulation approach for quantifying survival bias in lifecourse epidemiology.

R code to run simulation


## R Code for Simulation {.tabset}
There are 4 different R scripts, below is a summary of each file

Necessary R packages: 

 - `install.packages('lme4','ggplot2','MASS')`

### master_sim.R 
 - This is the master simulation file. This file calls the data generation and analysis files S times to generate and analyze S data  sets, stores the results from each iteration of data set generation, summarizes the results across the S data sets, and outputs simulation results.

 - requires: analysis.R, data_gen.R, parameter_gen.R
 - Assumes all R scripts are in the same working directory
 - Inputs:
     - Age: The age of your cohort, currently options are 60, 75, 90. These options can be expanded, however, additional work is necessary. 
     - Bsim: Number of iterations of sample generation you would like to run (2000)
     
 - Outputs: 
     - output from simulation runs, a file saved out in current directory that specfices the age and scenario of the run in the title.
           - `file = paste0('results',I,'_Age',Age,'.RDA',sep = ''))}`
           - e.g. `results1_Age90.RDA` for age 90 run at scenario 1 (I = 1)

### parameter_gen.R      
- This script generates the full set of parameters necessary for all scenarios (1:10), at a particular cohort Age (60,75,90)
- Contains one function: `SInputs(Age,survAge)`
- Generates causal structure design matrix (scenMat), see script for further details.

`survInfo`: a list containing cumulative mortality and log odds of death by Age(60,75,90) for reference group (g0) for each causal scenario. Cumulative mortality for each age is based on U.S. life tables for the 1929-1931 birth cohort (Arias, 2015); g0 values identified from previous simulations. This is hardcoded. Cannot be changed without further work. Email author if you would like to explore different ages. 

    - df60 = average g0 of S=2000 iterations of sample generation for each scenario (1:10)
    - df75 = average g0 of S=2000 iterations of sample generation for each scenario (1:10)
    - df90 = average g0 of S=2000 iterations of sample generation for each scenario (1:10)
    - survInfo = list(Age = c(60,75,90), DeathP = c(.31,.65,.97), g.init = list(df60,df75,df90))

Study Sample

    - N = 100000,       number of people in hypothetical population at age 20
    - sampSize = 2000,  number of people selected to participated in hypothetical cognitive aging cohort study (Age 60, 75, or 90 Study)
    - t.int = 1.5,   time between cognitive assessments in hypothetical cognitive aging study
    - n.obs = 7,     number of repeated cognitive assessments
    - pexp = .4,    prevalence of < high school education in hypothetical population cohort of 20-year-olds
    - p = with(data.frame(survAge[1],survAge[2]), DeathP[Age==A]), probability of death by Age (60,75,90) for hypothetical population of 20-year olds
    
Variances and correlations for cognitive function

    - s2z0 = 0.2,    variance of random cognitive intercept
    - s2z1 = 0.005,  variance of random cognitive slope 
    - sz01 = 0.01,    covariance of random intercept and random slope
    - s2e = 0.70,    variance of unexplained variation in Cij
    - rho = 0,       correlation between noise terms for Cij
    - s2d = 0,       variance of measurement error of Cij
    - b00 = 0,       cognitive intercept for unexposed (>=high school)
    - b01 = -0.5,    effect of exposure (<high school) on cognitive intercept
    - b02 = 0,       effect of U1 on cognitive intercept
    - b03 = 0,       effect of U2 on cognitive intercept
    - b10 = -0.05,  cognitive slope for unexposed (>=high school)
    - b11 = c(rep(-0.0375,8),-0.0125,-0.0375), effect of exposure (<high school) on cognitive slope
    - b12 = c(-0.025,rep(c(-0.025,-0.050,-0.025),2),rep(-0.025,3)), effect of U1 on cognitive slope
    - b13 = c(rep(-0.025,8),-0.075,-0.025), effect of U2 on cognitive slope
    
Cumulative Mortality Parameters

    - g0 = see `survInfo` above, log odds of death by Age(60,75,90) for reference group
    - g1 = c(rep(log(2),7),rep(log(sqrt(2)),2),log(2/sqrt(3))), log OR for effect of exposure (<high school) on death by Age(60,75,90)
    - g2 = c(0,rep(log(2),2),log(3),rep(0,6)), log OR for effect of U1 on death by Age(60,75,90)
    - g3 = c(rep(0,7),rep(log(2),2),log(3)), log OR for interaction between exposure (<high school) and U1 on death by Age(60,75,90)
    - g4 = c(rep(0,4),rep(log(2),2),log(3),rep(0,3)), log OR for effect of U2 on death by Age(60,75,90)
   
Education Effects

    - a0 = .5,        #Effect of exposure (<high school) on U2 (main lifetime occupational complexity)
    - a.sd = sqrt(1), #sd of effect of exposure on U2 
    - g.init = if(A==60){unlist(survAge[[3]][1])}else{
    - if(A==75){unlist(survAge[[3]][2])}else{
      unlist(survAge[[3]][3])}} ,  initial value for optimization to find g0
